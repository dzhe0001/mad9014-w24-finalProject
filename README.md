### Project Description
Ditch the folders and bulky software! This app lets searching photos with keywords, just like you search the web. Found a stunning sunset pic? Save it directly to your device for easy access later. But wait, there's more! Whenever a saved photo is opened, the app cleverly detects any faces in the picture, so you can see who's in the shot at a glance.
